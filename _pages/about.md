# About Me
* I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.unc.edu) at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
 advised by Prof. [Marc Niethammer](https://biag.cs.unc.edu/author/marc-niethammer/). I am fortunate to work closely with Prof. [Colin Raffle](https://colinraffel.com/) recently.
* My research interests lie in applying machine learning, particularly deep learning, to understanding images. 
I am facinated with exploring how to learn visual representations that generalizable to new domains/tasks with less labeled data. 
I also work on medical image registration and segmentation.  
* I received my Master's Degree on [Imaging Science](https://www.cis.rit.edu/) from Rochester Institute of Technology 
where I worked with Prof. [Nathan Cahill](https://people.rit.edu/ndcsma/) on remote sensing image analysis and image registration.
 I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree from Physics Department at Xi'an Jiaotong University, where I did research at Quantum Optics Lab with Prof. [Pei Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pei_Zhang5).
* I interned at Nvidia, Siemens Healthineers and Energy Initiative at Duke University during my Ph.D.
